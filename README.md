# Donation Inventory System
Adopted from the previous Capstone Project: <b>ULIKID BACOLOD: BACOLOD CITY DONATION WEB-BASED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</b>. This is a CRUD inventory system that can add, delete, edit, manage, and view donors, inventories, and distributions. This has three modules:

1. Donors Module
2. Inventory Module
3. Distribution Module

# Bugs Notice
- Deleting and Editing an Item from the Distribution Module does not fetch data correctly, and redirects to user to instead add an item
